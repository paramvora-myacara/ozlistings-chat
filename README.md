## Temporal Information Constraints

The system is configured to only provide information that is valid **after July 7, 2025**, when the Big Beautiful Bill was passed into law. This ensures:

- All responses reflect current legislation and regulations
- Historical information requests are redirected to current benefits
- Enhanced benefits under the Big Beautiful Bill are emphasized
- Compliance with updated post-July 7, 2025 requirements
- Focus on modernized tax advantages and incentives

The AI assistant will automatically redirect any requests for pre-July 7, 2025 information to current benefits and regulations under the new framework.
